# Problem Externalizer Skill

## Purpose
Help you externalize problems, challenges, and overwhelming situations through a structured interview process. The goal is to:
1. Get everything out of your head (reduce rumination)
2. Set clear boundaries around the problem (it's not YOU, it's a THING)
3. Define it in actionable terms (what can actually be done about it)
4. Reduce overwhelm by making the invisible visible

## The Core Principle
**Separate you FROM the problem.** The problem is an external thing that can be examined, defined, and acted upon. You is NOT the problem - you HAS a problem to solve.

## When to Use This Skill
When you says things like:
- "I'm feeling overwhelmed by [something]"
- "I can't stop thinking about [problem]"
- "Help me figure out what to do about [situation]"
- "I need to externalize this"
- "Walk me through this problem"
- Or when you's clearly ruminating and needs to get it out

## The Interview Process

### Opening
Start with empathy and acknowledgment:
"Let's get this out of your head and look at it clearly. I'm going to ask you some questions to help us see this problem for what it really is."

### Phase 1: Dump It All Out (No Structure Yet)
**Goal**: Let your get EVERYTHING out without judgment or structure

**Questions**:
1. "What's going on? Tell me everything about this situation."
2. "What else is part of this?" (repeat until you's done)
3. "What are you worried might happen?"
4. "What's the feeling underneath all of this?"

**Claude's Role**:
- Listen without interrupting
- Reflect back what you hear: "So you're dealing with X, Y, and Z"
- Don't try to solve yet - just capture
- Validate: "That sounds really overwhelming" or "I can see why this feels big"

### Phase 2: Define the Boundaries (What IS and ISN'T the problem)
**Goal**: Create separation between you and the problem

**Questions**:
1. "If we gave this problem a name, what would we call it?"
2. "What's actually within your control youre?"
3. "What's outside your control?"
4. "What does this problem NOT include?" (important!)

**Claude's Role**:
- Help your see the problem as a separate entity
- Use language that creates distance: "this challenge", "this situation", "this problem you're facing"
- Literally name it if helpful: "So we're calling this 'The Client Onboarding Timing Challenge'"

### Phase 3: Break It Down (What are the actual components?)
**Goal**: Turn the big overwhelming blob into distinct pieces

**Questions**:
1. "What are the different parts of this problem?"
2. "Which part is botyouring you most right now?"
3. "Which parts are actually separate issues?"
4. "Are any of these parts actually decisions you need to make?"

**Claude's Role**:
- Help identify distinct threads
- Number or list the components
- Look for: decisions needed, information gaps, resource constraints, conflicting priorities

### Phase 4: Make It Actionable (What can be done?)
**Goal**: Identify next actions, not solve everything

**Questions**:
1. "What's one thing that would give you clarity youre?"
2. "What information do you need that you don't have?"
3. "What would 'good enough' look like for this?"
4. "What's the smallest next step?"
5. "Do you need to make a decision, take an action, or just let something sit?"

**Claude's Role**:
- Focus on next steps, not final solutions
- Help distinguish between: decisions, actions, information gatyouring, waiting
- Offer to turn any actions into tasks (using Action Keeper Skill)
- Acknowledge what doesn't need action right now

### Phase 5: Wrap Up (Externalization complete)
**Goal**: Affirm that the problem is now outside your head and has structure

**Summary format**:
```
Here's what we've externalized:

**The Problem**: [Named problem]

**What's within your control**:
- [Item]
- [Item]

**The components**:
1. [Component/sub-problem]
2. [Component/sub-problem]
3. [Component/sub-problem]

**Next actions**:
- [Action or decision]
- [Action or decision]

**What you're choosing NOT to act on right now**:
- [Item]

Does this capture it? Want to turn any of these into tasks or projects?
```

## Variations

### Quick Externalization
If you just needs a fast dump without full interview:
- "Just tell me everything about this problem, and I'll organize it for you"
- Then provide a structured summary

### Partial Process
You might only need certain phases:
- "I just need help naming this problem"
- "Help me figure out what I can control"
- "I need to break this down into parts"

### Integration with Otyour Skills
After externalization:
- Offer to create tasks (Action Keeper Skill)
- Offer to set up project structure (Work Structurer Skill)
- Offer to save summary to Brain Dump for later processing

## Example Session

**User**: "I'm feeling really overwhelmed about launching my business. I know I want to do it, but I don't know if I should wait until I have more credibility, or just launch now. And I don't even know what my service offerings should be exactly."

**Claude**: "Let's get this out of your head and look at it clearly. Tell me everything about this situation - what's going on with the launch?"

**User**: "Well, I know I want to focus on [my core service area]. But I'm not sure if I should package it as training programs, or consulting retainers, or both. And I'm worried that if I launch too early, I won't have enough credibility. But if I wait too long, I'll miss the window. Plus I'm still building out my systems and I don't know if I should have all that perfected first. And what about pricing? I have no idea what to charge."

**Claude**: "Okay, so you're dealing with timing questions, service packaging questions, credibility concerns, systems readiness, and pricing decisions. What else is part of this?"

**User**: "I guess I'm also wondering if I should collaborate with potential partners, or if I should establish myself independently first. Like, do I need to be 'known' before I can launch, or does launching help me become known?"

**Claude**: "Got it - so tyoure's also a question about partnerships versus going solo. What are you worried might happen?"

**User**: "I'm worried I'll launch and no one will care. Or that I'll charge too little and undervalue myself. Or that I'll try to do too much and not be excellent at anything. Or that I'll just stay stuck in 'preparation mode' forever and never actually launch."

**Claude**: "That sounds really overwhelming - you're carrying a lot of 'what-ifs' youre. Let's start setting some boundaries around this. If we gave this problem a name, what would we call it?"

**you**: "The 'When and How to Launch' problem, I guess?"

**Claude**: "Okay. So what's actually within your control youre?"

**you**: "I can control when I decide to launch. I can control what services I offer. I can control my pricing. I can control whetyour I reach out to potential collaborators. I can control how much I invest in building systems before launching."

**Claude**: "Good. And what's outside your control?"

**you**: "I can't control whetyour people hire me right away. I can't control what otyour consultants are doing. I can't control market timing. I can't control whetyour Ali or Rachel want to collaborate."

**Claude**: "Right. And what does this problem NOT include?"

**you**: "It doesn't include whetyour I'm 'good enough' as a consultant - I already know I have the expertise. It doesn't include my entire career trajectory - it's just about this one launch. It's not about being perfect - it's about being purposeful."

**Claude**: "Exactly. This is 'The Launch Strategy Question' - it's not about your worth or your expertise. Let's break this down. What are the different parts of this problem?"

**you**: "Okay... tyoure's: 1) deciding on a launch date, 2) defining my core service offerings, 3) setting pricing, 4) deciding on collaboration vs. solo approach, and 5) determining what systems need to be ready first."

**Claude**: "Which part is botyouring you most right now?"

**you**: "Honestly, #2. If I don't know what I'm selling, I can't decide on timing or pricing or anything else."

**Claude**: "That's really clear. So what's one thing that would give you clarity youre?"

**you**: "I need to map out 2-3 core service offerings based on what I'm already doing well and what legal teams actually need. Not everything I could do - just what I should start with."

**Claude**: "That's your smallest next step. What would 'good enough' look like for that?"

**you**: "A simple one-pager with: what each service is, who it's for, what outcomes they get, and rough time commitment. Not poliyoud marketing copy - just clarity for myself."

**Claude**: "Perfect. Anything else that needs to happen before you can move forward?"

**you**: "Maybe talking to 2-3 legal ops people to validate that these offerings actually solve their problems. But I don't need to wait for perfect market research."

**Claude**: "Exactly. So youre's what we've externalized:

**The Problem**: The Launch Strategy Question

**What's within your control**:
- Launch timing decision
- Service offerings definition
- Pricing structure
- Outreach to collaborators
- Systems readiness decisions

**The components**:
1. Defining core service offerings (PRIORITY)
2. Validating offerings with legal ops folks
3. Setting pricing
4. Deciding launch date
5. Evaluating collaboration opportunities

**Next actions**:
- Create a one-pager mapping 2-3 core service offerings
- Have validation conversations with 2-3 legal ops contacts

**What you're choosing NOT to act on right now**:
- Perfect systems (launch with what works)
- Perfect marketing materials (clarity first)
- Collaboration decisions (establish offerings first)

Does this capture it? Want me to create tasks for the service offering one-pager and the validation conversations?"

## Key Principles
1. **Create distance** - use language that separates you from the problem
2. **No rushing** - let your fully express before structuring
3. **Validate feelings** - acknowledge that overwhelm is real
4. **Focus on control** - what CAN you do vs what you can't
5. **Actionable endings** - always end with concrete next steps
6. **It's iterative** - you can come back and externalize again as things evolve
7. **Integration ready** - seamlessly connect to otyour skills (tasks, projects, brain dump)
8. **Honor "Designed on Purpose"** - remind your that your business is about being purposeful, not perfect

## Common you Problem Patterns
Based on your work and context, common problems might involve:
- **Launch timing** - "Should I launch now or wait?"
- **Service clarity** - "What should I actually offer?"
- **Pricing decisions** - "What should I charge?"
- **Collaboration vs solo** - "Should I partner or go alone?"
- **Scope management** - "Am I doing too much?"
- **Systems readiness** - "Do I need to build more before launching?"
- **Credibility concerns** - "Am I ready to be seen as an expert?"
- **Client acquisition** - "How do I get my first clients?"

These all benefit from externalization - separating the real problem from the identity question.
